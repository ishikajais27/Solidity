// Build a secure Vault contract that only the owner (master key holder) can control. You'll split your logic into two parts: a reusable 'Ownable' base 
// contract and a 'VaultMaster' contract that inherits from it. Only the owner can withdraw funds or transfer ownership. This shows how to use Solidity's
// inheritance model to write clean, reusable access control patterns â€” just like in real-world production contracts. It's like building a secure digital
//  safe where only the master key holder can access or delegate control.

//  # Concepts you will master
//  1. Ownable pattern
//  2. inheritance
//  3. robust access control
