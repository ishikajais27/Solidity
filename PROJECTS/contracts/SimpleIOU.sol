// Build a simple IOU contract for a private group of friends. Each user can deposit ETH, track personal balances, log who owes who, and settle debts 
//all on-chain. Youâ€™ll learn how to accept real Ether using `payable`, transfer funds between addresses, and use nested mappings to represent relationships
// like 'Alice owes Bob'. This contract mirrors real-world borrowing and lending, and teaches you how to model those interactions in Solidity.
// # Concepts You'll Master
// 1. address
// 2. token transfer
// 3. payable for gas
// 4. validation (require)
